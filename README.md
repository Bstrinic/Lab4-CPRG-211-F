# Lab 4 CPRG-211 

The objective for this project is to create a basic calculator application using .NET MAUI in C# 

Things that we will cover throughout this lab: 

Using Grid Layout, Stack Layout, etc
Adding buttons for digits (0-9) and operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Equals, and others) 
Adding a TextBox

Furthermore we will have to implament the functionality of the calculator. Displaying user inputs whenever a button is 
pressed and to display the users answer to their equation. And last but not least is the clear button, we must make the 
clear button reset the current operation.
